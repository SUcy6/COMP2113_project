## Game description:
`Tetris Tornado` is a transformation of `Tetris`, a video game designed by Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984.
In `Tetris Tornado`, various shaped pieces *(called tetrominoes in this game)* fall onto the playing field from one of the 4 boundaries. There is a active tetris piece *(which is a 1-by-1 little square)* on the middle of the playing field at the beginning of each game. Players need to move or rotate the middle active tetris piece so that the middle piece can collide with the falling piece and form a new shape. If the player successfully complete a 3-by-3 square, the complete square will vanish and grant the player 1 point. If the middle active piece touches a boundary, game over. 
> In contrast, the original Tetris only has tetrominoes descending from the top to the bottom. Also, in the original game, players control the falling piece rather than the accumulational piece.
