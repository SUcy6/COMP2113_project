## Game description:
`Tetris Tornado` is a transformation of `Tetris`, a video game designed by Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984.
In `Tetris Tornado`, various shaped pieces *(called tetrominoes in this game)* fall onto the playing field from one of the 4 boundaries. There is a active tetris piece *(which is a 1-by-1 little square)* on the middle of the playing field at the beginning of each game. Players need to move or rotate the middle active tetris piece so that the middle piece can collide with the falling piece and form a new shape. If the player successfully complete a 3-by-3 square, the complete square will vanish and grant the player 1 point. If the middle active piece touches a boundary, game over. 
> In contrast, the original Tetris only has tetrominoes descending from the top to the bottom. Also, in the original game, players control the falling piece rather than the accumulational piece.  
## Game rules:
- Before the start of each game, choose `Sign in` or `Sign up`. If you are a new player, choose `Sign up` to enter a new username *(which canâ€™t be already exist names)*, then a text file will be made to store game records: username and best score. If you are a skilled player, choose `Sign in` and enter your username, then your game record will be called out. Game starts.
- A tile:blue_square: will be formed in the middle. Tetrominoes:green_square::green_square::green_square::green_square: will fall onto the playing field from top to bottom, from left to right, from right to left or from bottom to top. Only one teris piece drops in from one of the 4 directions each time.
- Players control the middle active piece so that the tile will collide falling teris and combine into a new teris. Press `'w'`, `'a'`, `'s'`, `'d'` to move the active piece `up`:arrow_up:, `left`:arrow_left:, `down`:arrow_down:, `right`:arrow_right:. Press `'j'`, `'k'` to rotate the teris `anti-clockwise`:arrow_right_hook: or `clockwise`:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:. Press `'q'` to quit the game and output a file of game status.

Game cases:

1. The middle tetris piece does not collide the falling teris piece. Falling tetris will disappear when it touches the end-point of its falling direction.
> E.g. the falling teris piece from left to right will vanish when it touches the right boundary.
2. The middle teris piece collides with the falling teris piece. Two pieces combine together to form new middle teris. Accumulatively, the middle active becomes larger and larger.
3. If the middle teris successfully complete a 3x3 matrix square, this square will disappear and the player gets one point. The remaining parts of middle piece will stay in their location. Even though the remains may be separated, we still look them as one piece.
